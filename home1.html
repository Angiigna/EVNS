      <P ><b>The dog</b> is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

         Stray dogs help in rodent populations by preying on them, which keeps their population in check. It also reduces the need to spray chemical pesticides to kill these rodents, thereby promoting a healthier environment. Stray dogs also help in managing the population of small insects and other pests; this limits the spread of diseases and protects the crops from being damaged. Stray dogs role in balancing this process highlights their importance and the need to ensure that their population is effectively managed as we also acknowledge their ecological contributions. <br><br>
         
        <b style="font-size: 1.3em;color: green;"> Ecological Balancers</b> <br><br>
         By preying on small insects and rodents, stray dogs play an important role in indirectly supporting the survival of various plants and animal species that otherwise can be impacted by these pests. Additionally, stray dogs scavenging role helps in the process of decomposition of organic  waste. They consume these wastes, including animal carcasses, and aid in decomposition and nutrients cycling in the environment. <br><br>

        <b style="font-size: 1.3em; color: green;"> Human Benefits</b> <br><br>
         In addition to their ecological role of reducing rodents and other pests, which help in reducing the spread of several diseases such as leptospirosis and hantavirus, stray dogs also offer social and emotional benefits to the communities. They can be informal companions to people, especially the lonely or those who live in isolation. Their presence also brings people together who shower them with care and affection. This enhances empathy and kindness in the community. <br><br>

          <h3>Common Dog Behavior Observations</h3>
          <p>
            <b style = "color: green;">Territorial Instincts:</b> Dogs tend to establish territories
            around hostels and cafeterias, where they feel safe and can access
            food easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b style = "color: green;">Routine Activities:</b> Most dogs follow a predictable
            routine—roaming in groups, resting in shaded areas, and scavenging
            for food at specific times.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b style = "color: green;">Social Groups:</b> Dogs often form packs based on familiarity and
            hierarchy. Conflicts between groups usually occur over food or
            territory.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b style = "color: green;">Friendly vs. Cautious Behavior:</b> While some dogs are friendly
            towards students, others remain cautious, especially at night or
            when unfamiliar people approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b style = "color: green;">Mother Dogs & Puppies:</b> Female dogs with puppies are highly
            protective and prefer to stay in quiet, less-disturbed areas.

            <h1>BINOMIAL NAME: <I> Corvus splendens </I></h1>
          <P ><b>The Crow</b> is a highly intelligent bird belonging to the Corvidae family. Crows are known for their problem-solving abilities, tool use, and complex social behaviors. They are found all over the world and have adapted exceptionally well to urban and rural environments. Crows have long been associated with humans, often thriving in human settlements by scavenging and using our waste as a food source. Their remarkable memory and learning capacity make them one of the most fascinating bird species in the animal kingdom.

            <h1>ECOLOGICAL ROLE:</h1>
            <b>Natural Waste Managers</b> <br>
            Crows are efficient scavengers. They feed on organic waste, carrion, and discarded food, reducing the volume of waste and helping to maintain cleanliness in urban environments. This natural waste management limits the spread of diseases and reduces the need for human-led waste cleanup. <br>
            
            <b> Pest Control</b> <br>
            Crows also help control the population of various insects, small rodents, and even agricultural pests by feeding on them. Their diet includes caterpillars, beetles, grasshoppers, and other crop-damaging organisms, which makes them beneficial in protecting agricultural ecosystems. <br>

            <b> Seed Dispersal Agents</b> <br>
            By consuming fruits and later excreting the seeds, crows contribute to plant propagation and biodiversity. Their movement across different habitats allows for wide dispersal of seeds, especially in fragmented environments. <br>
          
            <b> Human Benefits</b> <br>
            Crows play a unique role in human society by acting as environmental indicators. Their presence and behavior can signal changes in the ecosystem, such as pollution or food scarcity. In addition, their intelligence has fascinated researchers, educators, and nature lovers alike. Crows are known to recognize human faces, hold grudges, and even exchange “gifts” with people they trust.          Socially, in some cultures, crows are associated with mythology, ancestral spirits, and omens. Observing and engaging with crows can foster curiosity, respect for wildlife, and awareness of ecological interdependence. <br>

            <h3>Common Crow Behavior Observations</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Territorial Instincts:</b> Crows often establish territories around tree clusters, rooftops, and food sources like garbage bins, canteens, and marketplaces. They defend these areas from other animals and rival crow groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Routine Activities:</b>Crows typically follow a daily routine, scavenging for food in open areas, markets, and around human settlements, resting in shaded trees or high structures, often grooming themselves or socializing, gathering in large numbers (called a roost) at specific spots like tall trees or quiet areas for resting.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Social Groups:</b>Crows live in social groups or flocks. These groups have a certain pecking order (hierarchy). Stronger, older crows dominates. Conflicts happen over food, space, or nesting spots. Crows often cooperate to chase away threats or alert each other to danger.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Nesting & Parenting:</b> Crows build nests high up in trees or buildings using twigs, wires, and cloth pieces. Mother crows are highly protective of their nests and chicks. They often stay in quiet, undisturbed spots and can become aggressive if approached
