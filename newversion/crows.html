        <h1>BINOMIAL NAME: <i>Corvus splendens</i></h1>
        <p>
          <b>The Crow</b> is a highly intelligent bird belonging to the Corvidae
          family. Crows are known for their problem-solving abilities, tool use,
          and complex social behaviors. They are found all over the world and
          have adapted exceptionally well to urban and rural environments. Crows
          have long been associated with humans, often thriving in human
          settlements by scavenging and using our waste as a food source. Their
          remarkable memory and learning capacity make them one of the most
          fascinating bird species in the animal kingdom.

          <h1>ECOLOGICAL ROLE:</h1>
          <p>
            <b>Natural Waste Managers</b><br />
            Crows are efficient scavengers. They feed on organic waste, carrion,
            and discarded food, reducing the volume of waste and helping to
            maintain cleanliness in urban environments. This natural waste
            management limits the spread of diseases and reduces the need for
            human-led waste cleanup.<br />

            <b>Pest Control</b><br />
            Crows also help control the population of various insects, small
            rodents, and even agricultural pests by feeding on them. Their diet
            includes caterpillars, beetles, grasshoppers, and other
            crop-damaging organisms, which makes them beneficial in protecting
            agricultural ecosystems.<br />

            <b>Seed Dispersal Agents</b><br />
            By consuming fruits and later excreting the seeds, crows contribute
            to plant propagation and biodiversity. Their movement across
            different habitats allows for wide dispersal of seeds, especially in
            fragmented environments.<br />

            <b>Human Benefits</b><br />
            Crows play a unique role in human society by acting as environmental
            indicators. Their presence and behavior can signal changes in the
            ecosystem, such as pollution or food scarcity. In addition, their
            intelligence has fascinated researchers, educators, and nature
            lovers alike. Crows are known to recognize human faces, hold
            grudges, and even exchange “gifts” with people they trust. Socially,
            in some cultures, crows are associated with mythology, ancestral
            spirits, and omens. Observing and engaging with crows can foster
            curiosity, respect for wildlife, and awareness of ecological
            interdependence.

        <h3>Common Crow Behavior Observations</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Territorial Instincts:</b> Crows often establish territories around
          tree clusters, rooftops, and food sources like garbage bins, canteens,
          and marketplaces. They defend these areas from other animals and rival
          crow groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Routine Activities:</b> Crows typically follow a daily routine,
          scavenging for food in open areas, markets, and around human
          settlements, resting in shaded trees or high structures, often
          grooming themselves or socializing, gathering in large numbers (called
          a roost) at specific spots like tall trees or quiet areas for resting.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Social Groups:</b> Crows live in social groups or flocks. These
          groups have a certain pecking order (hierarchy). Stronger, older crows
          dominate. Conflicts happen over food, space, or nesting spots. Crows
          often cooperate to chase away threats or alert each other to danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Nesting & Parenting:</b> Crows build nests high up in trees or
          buildings using twigs, wires, and cloth pieces. Mother crows are
          highly protective of their nests and chicks. They often stay in quiet,
          undisturbed spots and can become aggressive if approached.
