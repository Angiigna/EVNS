      <h1>
        HONOURABLE MENTION <i><br />His Highness, Poco</i>
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the annals of Pondicherry University, one name shall forever echo
        with loyalty, nobility, and love—<b>Poco</b>. A noble guardian, a silent
        sentry, and the softest of souls, His Highness reigned over our campus
        with dignity and unmatched devotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be it under the starlit skies or sunlit streets, Poco walked not behind
        us—but beside us, as a friend, a protector, and a king in his own right.
        With every wag of his royal tail and every bark of warning, he reminded
        us that chivalry is not dead—and that sometimes, heroes have paws
        instead of swords.
      </p>
